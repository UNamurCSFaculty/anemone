# Anemone

## Description

Anemone is a workbench for describing concurrent systems using a Linda-like language, for animating them and for reasoning on them using a reachability logic.

More information on the workbench and its underlying process algebra can be found at the webpage

Videos explaining the use of the workbench are available at the webpage

The source code is available from this github repository together with a jar file. Case studies can also be found on this github repository as well as a tutorial article on the use of the workbench.


## For the impatient

Save the anemone.jar file under a directory, say myDir, go to to the working directory where the Multi-Bach program is (together with images for animations) and then type 

java -jar myDir/anemone.jar
